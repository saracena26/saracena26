ðŸ“Œ About Me:  
Iâ€™m a Cybersecurity, Networking, and Cloud student building a strong IT foundation through hands-on learning. So far, Iâ€™ve been developing skills in operating systems, networking, troubleshooting, and cybersecurity best practicesâ€”with a growing passion for how systems work and how to secure them.

ðŸ’¡ Skills & Learning Path:  
- IT Fundamentals: Basic OS, Hardware, Networking, and Troubleshooting  
- Cybersecurity Principles: CIA Triad, AAA, Risk Management  
- Cloud Technologies: AWS, Security Best Practices for Cloud Environments 
- Security Tools: Wireshark, Nmap, Kali Linux, Snort, Wazzuh 

ðŸ“‚ Projects & Labs:  
- Setting up a Virtual Lab with VMs | Linux Node Cluster 
-Set up a closed-network Linux cluster with one Ubuntu Server providing internet access and two internal nodes. Configured SSH communication between all machines to simulate a basic internal infrastructure and support secure remote management within an isolated environment.

- Hands-on Labs in Threat Detection | Red and Blue team Tactics in a closed Enviroment
-Designed and deployed a virtual honeypot environment using VirtualBox, featuring pfSense, Kali Linux, Metasploitable 2, Windows 10, and Ubuntu with Wazuh. Simulated real-world attacks, including SQL injection, and monitored threat activity using Snort IDS/IPS and Wazuh SIEM. Demonstrated both Red Team (offensive) and Blue Team (defensive) tactics to analyze and respond to malicious behavior in a controlled, isolated network.
