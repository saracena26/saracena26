Cybersecurity | Networking | Cloud | Student @ The Knowledge House Cyber Security Program

## About Me:  
I’m a Cybersecurity, Networking, and Cloud student building a strong IT foundation through hands-on learning. So far, I’ve been developing skills in operating systems, networking, troubleshooting, and cybersecurity best practices—with a growing passion for how systems work and how to secure them.

## Skills & Learning Path:  
- IT Fundamentals: Basic OS, Hardware, Networking, and Troubleshooting  
- Cybersecurity Principles: CIA Triad, AAA, Risk Management  
- Cloud Technologies: AWS, Security Best Practices for Cloud Environments 
- Security Tools: Wireshark, Nmap, Kali Linux, Snort, Wazzuh 

## Projects & Labs:  
Setting Up a Virtual Lab with VMs | Linux Node Cluster  

- Set up a closed-network Linux cluster with one **Ubuntu Server** providing internet access and two internal nodes.  
- Configured **SSH communication** between all machines to simulate a basic internal infrastructure.  
- Enabled secure remote management and tested inter-node connectivity within an **isolated environment**.

  
Hands-on Labs in Threat Detection | Red and Blue Team Tactics in a Closed Environment  

- Designed and deployed a virtual honeypot environment using **VirtualBox**, featuring:
  - pfSense  
  - Kali Linux  
  - Metasploitable 2  
  - Windows 10  
  - Ubuntu with Wazuh  
- Simulated real-world attacks including **SQL injection**.
- Monitored threat activity using **Snort IDS/IPS** and **Wazuh SIEM**.
- Demonstrated both **Red Team (offensive)** and **Blue Team (defensive)** tactics in a fully isolated network.

## In Progress  
Home Cloud Storage Server  

- Currently building a **self-hosted cloud storage solution** using a Linux-based Mini PC.  
- Exploring tools like **Nextcloud**, **Samba**, and **NFS** for file sharing and remote access.  
- Project goals include secure file syncing, local network access, remote backup support, and user account control.  
- Will be deployed on an isolated subnet with firewall rules and future integration into my virtual lab environment.
